    "solution": "A mobile application that allows you to measure the speed of toy cars and know what speed they would reach if they were the size of a real car. Through the device’s camera, we can verify that when a toy car is propelled by a child, if its size were like that of its dad’s, it would reach up to speeds of more than 1000 kilometers per hour. An entertaining way of using your mobile to get kids to play in the physical world again.",

    "description": "We use €1 coins of legal tender as the communication medium, leaving them on the streets of Barcelona so that people would find them and read our message.",
    "problem": "We needed to find a striking way to communicate the concept of this NGO whose main idea was complicated to understand, and create a striking action that would make this new NGO known. Teaming enables companies to have their employees donate €1 of their payroll every month, and, in this way, in addition to doing a charitable act, they interact positively as a team and improve their relationships as co-workers. The project has evolved so that now there is an online platform for team meetings and relationships beyond the companies.",
    "solution": "We distributed €300 in €1 coins of legal tender throughout the city of Barcelona with an adhesive on the side of the coin that was in contact with the ground that read: “You dare to be born again euro.timing.info” The press and radio gave the originality of the idea a good response. The 20-minutos newspaper covered the news the two days the action took place.",
